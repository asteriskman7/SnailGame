This [incremental game](https://reddit.com/r/incremental_games) is a spinoff of my [Snail Clocks](https://github.com/asteriskman7/SnailClocks) project.

I've gamified a few of the clocks and added a new one that didn't make it into the project.

This game serves two main purposes:

1. Revisit the clocks for the people who are already familiar with them
2. Experiment with alternate input schemes for incremental games
